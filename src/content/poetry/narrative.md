Some are cynically doomed by the narrative; an enchanting lotus uprooted albeit its waxy leaves; its deadly roots desperately wrapping around the feet of the harvester. Some drown; most live with algae coated lungs.
Have you ever thought beyond your own interests? With a blink, you toss me as if you'd seen my fingertips rotting.
Sever whatever goes against your will with no remorse, even if it is the umbilical cord.
