Anatomy puppeteered by an incomprehensible longing. Diamond wires pull; slicing through arteries guiding red seepage into bone. Lungs expand against a field of grief. Clean air morphs into grey, ugly static flooding alveoli, rotting your viscera from the inside.
Arms overflowing with noise, a bundle of colour. Hungry, imposing, she has your barren eyes.
