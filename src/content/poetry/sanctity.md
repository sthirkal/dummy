We carry the dead to its burial like God; death is sanctity.
And even with the belief of salvation, even with the begging of repentance,
Your gaze falls like the spring dawnâ€™s sun across my shoulders,
Your lips drench mine in the sweetest rot,
Thus my longing for death falls to die; sanctity lies in your touch.
